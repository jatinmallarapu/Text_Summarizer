# Interactive Text Summarizer

## AIM:
This project utilizes a TensorFlow-based model to generate summaries for news articles. The model employs a combination of tokenization, padding, and LSTM layers. The objective is to automatically generate concise and accurate summaries from given articles.

## Models Used:

1) Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
2) LSTM Layer: Captures sequential patterns in data for context understanding.
3) Dense Layer: Produces output probabilities for target vocabulary.
5) Tokenization and Padding: Utilized to preprocess text data efficiently.

## Daily Scenario:
This project finds practical application in summarizing news articles, saving time for users seeking quick insights. It enhances information consumption, aiding those with limited time to stay informed about current events more effectively.

## Conclusion:
The project showcases the power of natural language processing in automating summarization tasks. Through LSTM-based modeling, it achieves meaningful results, making it a valuable tool for content summarization in various domains, particularly in the realm of news and information consumption.
